Like many kids, I grew up thinking coffee is what old guys drink before they head to work &ndash;
Usually brewed in an oversized coffee pot. It turned your teeth yellow and made your breath
smell bad. Sugar made it better, I guess, but certainly not a replacement for root beer or juice.

Today, at 27, I'm all about coffee. Not the nasty coffee my dad drank before work or the coffee
synonymous with impatient drive-through Starbucks customers, but a kind of coffee that is meant to
be cared for using geekish coffee paraphernalia, ground on demand and carefully brewed cup by cup.

You have to believe me when I say that I know this all sounds a bit snobbish. I guess I'm comfortable
calling myself a coffee snob, if snob means that I care about the quality of the things I enjoy.

Recently I've been getting into home roasting and various brewing techniques that I plan on covering
in detail here. Perhaps I can help lure someone out of the irritable line at Starbucks and into
a much more satisfying coffee experience.

Stay tuned.
