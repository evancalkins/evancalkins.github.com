In the past several months, I've highly enjoyed roasting my own coffee at my home. The process is surprisingly
simple, quick, cost effective, and can produce an amazing cup of coffee. Before I begin to explain the process, it
is worth mentioning that this isn't just for coffee geeks - it's a great way for anybody who enjoys coffee to
considerably improve their coffee experience. With that said, let's begin:

<h3>Find a Roaster</h3>

There are a <a href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/prod.roasters.php">handful</a> of expensive, small batch home roasters, but
we&rsquo;ll skip those for now and go straight for the pop corn popper! It seems like a shoddy way to roast, but it
can actually produce results that rival the more expensive equipment.

First, you&rsquo;ll want to take a trip down to your local thrift store and rummage about the home appliance section.
Chances are, you can find an old popper for around $5. You don&rsquo;t want any old roaster though, you&rsquo;ll want to
make sure you find one that has air louvers on the sides of the inner chamber. The poppers with a
screen on the bottom tend to be underpowered and can&rsquo;t oscillate the air properly. If you can&rsquo;t find a used popper,
you may have to shell out a bit more for a new popper &ndash; just make sure it has the louvers in the chamber.

<h3>Purchase Green Coffee</h3>

Green Coffee is the term given to unroasted coffee beans. It is much smaller, harder, and heavier than roasted
coffee. There are various vendors that sell green coffee on the internet, but I highly recommend purchasing from
<a href="http://sweetmarias.com">Sweet Maria&rsquo;s</a>.

Sweet Maria&rsquo;s does most of the hard work for you &ndash; they research, test, and purchase some of the most amazing
coffees on earth. In addition, they give reviews, flavor profiles, and roasting tips for each coffee they
sell. For most coffees, they sell as little as one pound at a time. To begin, I highly recommend purchasing
their <a href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/sweetmarias/coffee/samplers/green-coffee-sampler.html">green coffee sampler</a>,
which gives you a unique daily selection of 4 different coffees, one pound of each.

<h3>The Roasting Process</h3>

It is best to set your roasting popper beneath a vent if you are roasting in your house. The vent above my kitchen
oven works great. If you have no ventilation, try roasting outside or in your garage. The process can create smoke,
and leave your house smelling like roasted coffee for days (not necessarily a bad thing).

Before you begin, here are some items you&rsquo;ll need: Two large colanders, a wooden spoon, a few damp paper towels
and a timer.

<h4>Let&rsquo;s Get Started</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Warm Up</strong><br/>
I like to warm up my popper before I roast the first batch. It helps keep the roasting time of the first batch consistent
with the next. Go ahead and turn the popper on for four or five minutes to warm it up. You can leave the top off.</li>
<li><strong>The Set Up</strong><br/>
As the popper is warming, set up your roasting area with your colander and wet towels to catch the chaff. Also, you&rsquo;ll
want the second colander next to the popper so you can empty the roasted beans from the popper when they are finished
roasting.</li>
<li><strong>The Beans</strong>
You can roast anywhere from 1/3 to a full cup of green coffee in your popper. I have found that a heaping &frac12; cup works
best. This is something worth experimenting with as each popper is different. After the warming period, shut the popper off
and add your green coffee.
Uneven roasting is something you want to avoid, and an improper amount of coffee can
be the cause.</li>
<li><strong>The Roast</strong><br/>
Start your timer and turn the popper on without the top on. Use your wooden spoon to help stir the beans. Because the beans
are heavy when green, the air from the popper has a hard time moving the beans properly in the beginning. This will help
create a consistent roast. I like to stir for about 45 seconds before I put the top on the popper. Watch the coffee
quickly change color from the light green to tan. In the next steps, use your timer to note key points in the roasting process.</li>
<li><strong>First Crack</strong><br/>
The &ldquo;first crack&rdquo; during the roasting process is very important, because along with the color of the coffee, much of the
success of your roast is based off this crack. At around the <strong>3 minute</strong> mark (give or take a minute for different
poppers), you&rsquo;ll start to hear a sharp crack, or pop from the beans. This first crack portion of the roast usually lasts
about a minute. A coffee is said to be drinkable after all beans finish with their first crack. If you were to stop the
roasting now, this type of roast would be called a &ldquo;City Roast.&rdquo; Although drinkable, it is much too light
for most coffees and can taste very bitter and generally undesirable.</li>
<li><strong>Between First and Second Crack</strong>  <br/>
After the first crack has finished, the coffee will really start to develop its flavor profiles. You&rsquo;ll want to start
carefully watching the color of your coffee at this point. If not careful, the coffee can be easily over-roasted. Fifteen to
Thirty seconds of roasting can make a huge difference. After a couple minutes of roasting past the first crack
(around <strong>6 minutes</strong>), the coffee will be approaching the second crack. For most coffee I roast, I like to stop the roast
right before the second crack begins. With that said, some coffees are best when stopped at the beginning, or during the second
crack. If the color of your beans are looking good, and you want to stop the roast now, stop the popper, and empty your beans
as quickly as possible into your second colander.</li>
<li><strong>Second Crack</strong><br/>
If you haven&rsquo;t stopped your coffee yet, you may begin to hear a second crack. This crack is more difficult to hear and
sounds a lot like Rice Crispy cereal. Many darker roasts, or &ldquo;Vienna&rdquo; roasts are roasted well into the second crack. Most
Starbucks coffees are roasted near the end of the second crack. For most coffees, in my opinion, this is over roasting and
can mask many of the great qualities of the specific coffee you are roasting.</li>
<li><strong>Cool &lsquo;em Down</strong><br/>
The cool down process is very important. The quicker you can stop the roast and cool the coffee,
the better. If the coffee stays too hot for too long, it will continue to roast past the desired amount. As soon as you&rsquo;re finished
roasting, empty the beans into the colander and rush outside as you sift the beans. After a couple of minutes, the beans should be
cool enough to touch.</li>
<li><strong>After Roast</strong><br/>
After the beans are cool to the touch, I prefer to wait a day before I drink the coffee. Fresh roasted coffee is extremely
effervescent and it&rsquo;s worth letting some Co2 escape from the coffee. Actually, I prefer consuming the coffee two days after
I roast it. With that said, the coffee is perfectly fine to drink directly after the roast if you prefer.<br/>
Another thing worth discussing is the storage of your coffee. It&rsquo;s best to store your coffee in an air tight container. Although,
directly after you roast, let your coffee breath for a few hours before you tighten the lid on your container. Mason jars
work great because they have a handy, air-tight screw lid and are easy to store and stack.</li>
</ol>

There are endless techniques and schools of thought on how to roast coffee properly, but the best way is to
practice and experiment. There is no law book that dictates how long coffee should be roasted. Fine tune your roast to your
liking and have fun!
